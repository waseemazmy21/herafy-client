# Herafy Frontend

The **Herafy Frontend** is the user interface for the **Herafy** platform, a freelance marketplace designed to connect clients with skilled craftsmen. This frontend application allows clients to post jobs, browse proposals, and review completed work, while craftsmen can submit proposals and manage their profiles. The frontend consumes the **Herafy Backend API** to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Clients and craftsmen can register and log in.
- **Job Posting**: Clients can create job posts that require services.
- **Proposal Submission**: Craftsmen can browse and submit proposals for available jobs.
- **Job Management**: Clients can review proposals and select a craftsman.
- **Review System**: After completing a job, clients can leave reviews and ratings for the craftsman.

## Technologies Used

The frontend is built using modern web technologies for a responsive and dynamic user interface:

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing the frontend.
- **ShadCN/UI**: Component library to provide reusable and styled UI components.
- **Axios**: HTTP client to consume the **Herafy Backend API**.
